Got you chief 👊 I see what happened — you want that **structured, step-by-step plan** again, but one that covers *both sides*:

1. **Website development (self-built, GitHub setup, deploy, etc.)**
2. **Instagram marketing (3-day teaser build-up → final reveal)**

And since you’ve already done HTML/CSS/JS basics (not pro yet, but comfortable editing), I’ll make the plan *beginner-friendly but real-world*, so you can both practice coding **and** pull off this Bugatti/Mansory-style launch.

---

## 🔥 Master Plan (Today → Launch)

We’ll split into **Website** track and **Instagram** track.
Launch target: **Tuesday Sep 2, 2025** (so today Fri → Tue = 4 days).

---

### 1. Website Development Plan

*(We’ll do it properly — your own site, no Wix)*

#### Step 1 — Set up GitHub & Project (Today, Fri)

* Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you don’t have it.
* Create a GitHub account (if not yet).
* In VS Code:

  ```bash
  git init
  git branch -M main
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
  git push -u origin main
  ```
* Repo is live. This is your “source of truth.”

#### Step 2 — Code base (Sat)

* Use the **template** I gave you (hero + countdown + gallery + about + collab + contact).
* Replace text + images (your 6 liveries, hero, og preview).
* Set your **launch date** inside `LAUNCH_DATE` in the script.
* Test locally: open `index.html` in browser.

#### Step 3 — Deploy (Sun)

* Use **Netlify** (super easy + free + contact forms work).
* Steps:

  * Sign up on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
  * “New Site → From Git → Connect GitHub → Choose repo.”
  * Done. You get a free subdomain like `coastcustoms.netlify.app`.
* Check the site on phone + desktop.

#### Step 4 — Polish (Mon)

* Mobile responsive test.
* SEO: update `<meta>` tags (title, description, OG image).
* Add Instagram & email links in footer.
* (Optional) Custom domain if you want (like `coastcustoms.xyz`).

### 2. Instagram Teaser Plan

*(3-day drip, like Bugatti / Mansory pre-release)*

#### Sat (Aug 30) — **Teaser 1 (Mystery vibe)**

* Story & Feed: Close-up detail shot (headlight, carbon, spoiler) with text:

  * Story text: *“A new era of liveries is coming.”*
  * Feed caption: *“Coast Customs presents something new… Stay tuned.”*
* No mention of how many liveries. Just mystery.

#### Sun (Aug 31) — **Teaser 2 (Collection hint)**

* Story: silhouette image / blurred full car shot.
* Feed: Carousel of 2–3 cropped shots.
* Caption: *“6 designs. Inspired by Mansory, Bugatti, and more. Launching Sept 2.”*
* Add **Countdown sticker** in story.

#### Mon (Sep 1) — **Teaser 3 (Collab hype)**

* Story & Feed: Reveal collab with Hellcat creator.
* Caption: *“Collab preview: \[CreatorName] x Coast Customs. The Hellcat edition.”*
* This builds trust + hype from their audience.

#### Tue (Sep 2) — **Main Drop (Full launch)**

* Feed: Post carousel with hero shots of all 6 designs.
* Caption: *“The collection is live. Explore full gallery → link in bio.”*
* Story: 15s reel with cinematic shots + “LIVE NOW.”
* Collab creators post at same time.

### 3. Learning Support While Doing This

Since you’re still getting comfortable with HTML/CSS/JS:

* You’ll **learn by editing the template** instead of building from scratch.
* As you swap images, tweak text, and test the countdown, you’ll practice:

  * Updating `<img>` and `<div>` structure (HTML)
  * Adjusting colors, sizes, spacing (CSS)
  * Playing with countdown script (JS)
* By launch, you’ll be way more comfortable editing a *real* project.

---

## 🚀 Recap Timeline

* **Fri (Today)** → Set up GitHub, prep images, copy.
* **Sat** → Edit site content + Post Teaser 1.
* **Sun** → Deploy on Netlify + Post Teaser 2.
* **Mon** → Polish site + Post Teaser 3 (collab).
* **Tue** → Launch post, collabs go live, site traffic in.

Do you want me to **expand this into a “daily checklist” with exact copy-paste commands** (like Git commands, Netlify steps, Instagram caption text), so you can literally follow it like a script?
